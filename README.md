# Belly Button Biodiversity Challenge

In this challenge, I built an [interactive dashboard](https://scrannad.github.io/Belly_button_code/index.html) to explore the [Belly Button Biodiversity dataset](http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/), which catalogs the microbes that colonize human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare.

This challenge utilizes HTML, javascript, plotly, and Github Pages to create interactive visualizations exploring the dataset. 

I used interactive horizontal bar graphs

and bubble charts to display the data.

Access the dashboard [here](https://scrannad.github.io/Belly_button_code/index.html), and use the dropdown menu to explore the belly button samples for each test subject. 

Code for this assignment was written combining code samples from multiple activities through Module 14.
